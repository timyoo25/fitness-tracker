## API and Data Sample

Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your Airtable (you can find it under the API documentation) so we know you can access it and get the info you need. This **must** be properly formatted. An example is below:

{
"records": [
{
"id": "recf7TwzUF9PacZe0",
"fields": {
"body": [
"Push",
"Pull",
"Legs"
],
"name": "Weight Lifting",
"exercise": "Bench Press",
"sets": "3",
"reps": "5",
"weight": "225"
},
"createdTime": "2021-06-06T19:29:53.000Z"
},
{
"id": "recssulCz4pH1hHtF",
"fields": {},
"createdTime": "2021-06-06T19:29:53.000Z"
},
{
"id": "recdcj8tl47qZZepG",
"fields": {},
"createdTime": "2021-06-06T19:29:53.000Z"
}
],
"offset": "recdcj8tl47qZZepG"
}

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP. Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.

#### MVP

_These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features._

- Upload API from customized Airtable data
- Allow user to input custom forms containing workout data and tracking
- Home page with clickable images that will route to targeted page

#### PostMVP

_These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features._

- Use local storage so user can have saved inputs and look at previous entries
- Add a calendar so that a user can select which date the exercises were performed on
- Add calorie tracker
- Render mobile version
- Add delete button for any mistakes/typos

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations. Here's an example.

| Day        | Deliverable                                        | Status     |

| July 10-12 | Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes | Incomplete |
| July 13    | Project Approval                                   | Incomplete |
| July 13    | Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.)       | Incomplete |
| July 14    | Pseudocode / actual code                           | Incomplete |
| July 15    | Initial Clickable Model                            | Incomplete |
| July 16    | MVP                                                | Incomplete |

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all parts of your app. Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the app must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add an additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

I have a good idea of what I want to produce and render and giving freedom to the user input. I think that I can reference most labs/homeworks for additional guidance.

### Weaknesses:

I think I will need further guidance with piecing everything together and knowing which syntax to use in specific situations (eg Route vs Link)

### Opportunities:

This project will allow me to really understand how to use React effectively with UseState and UseEffect. I am nervous but also excited to see how much understanding I can apply to the project. I am most interested in functionality first and creating a good user experience with navigation. This will be a good opportunity to allow myself to struggle through any problems rather than looking for a quick exit/answer.

### Threats:

If I get stuck, I tend to panic a little bit and immediately jump to the conclusion that I don't know anything. I need to get better at practicing debugging and googling effectively (or using my resources). I will try my best to do everything as independent as I can and asking for help when really needed.
